# Volunteer Management Optimization System
## Business Proposal for TDX 2025 Agentforce Hackathon
### Executive Summary
VolunteerForce is an AI-powered volunteer management solution built on Salesforce's Agentforce
platform that transforms how nonprofit organizations recruit, onboard, and retain volunteers. By
leveraging CRM data and AI agents, our system creates perfect matches between volunteers and
projects, streamlines the onboarding process, and proactively addresses volunteer burnout before it
occurs.
### The Problem
Nonprofits face three critical challenges in volunteer management:
1. **Ineﬃcient Matching**: Manual assignment processes fail to optimize volunteer skills and
project needs
2. **Inconsistent Onboarding**: Training delivery varies widely, leading to knowledge gaps and
reduced eﬀectiveness
3. **High Turnover**: Without proactive engagement, volunteer burnout leads to costly
recruitment cycles
### Our Solution
VolunteerForce consists of three integrated AI agents:
1. **MatchMaker Agent**
- Analyzes volunteer profiles including skills, availability, and performance history
- Evaluates project requirements and complexity
- Recommends optimal volunteer-project pairings
- Automatically schedules assignments and sends notifications
2. **OnboardingPro Agent**
- Delivers personalized training paths based on role requirements
- Tracks certification completion and knowledge gaps
- Provides just-in-time learning resources
- Automates follow-up for incomplete training
3. **RetentionGuard Agent**
- Monitors engagement patterns to identify early warning signs of burnout
- Recognizes volunteer achievements and triggers appropriate recognition
- Suggests personalized re-engagement strategies
- Provides insights on organizational retention trends
### Technical Implementation
Our solution leverages Salesforce's Agentforce platform:

**AI Capabilities**: Natural language processing, pattern recognition, predictive analytics

**Integration Points**: Calendar systems, learning management platforms, communication tools

**User Interfaces**: Mobile-friendly dashboards for volunteers and administrators
### Impact Metrics
VolunteerForce delivers measurable results:
- 40% reduction in volunteer-project mismatch rates
- 65% faster onboarding completion

### Team Expertise

### Conclusion
VolunteerForce represents a transformative approach to volunteer management that aligns
perfectly with the goals of the TDX 2025 Agentforce Hackathon. By leveraging Salesforce's powerful
platform and AI capabilities, we're creating a solution that will help nonprofits maximize their
impact through more eﬀective volunteer engagement.
