# Technical Proposal

# VolunteerForce: AI-Powered Volunteer Management System
## Technical Proposal for Launchpad Initiative - TDX 2025 Agentforce Hackathon

### Executive Summary

VolunteerForce is a comprehensive volunteer management solution built on Salesforce's Agentforce platform, specifically designed for Launchpad Initiative's volunteer ecosystem. This AI-driven system revolutionizes how nonprofits recruit, onboard, and retain volunteers by leveraging advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. Our solution creates precise matches between volunteers and projects, streamlines the onboarding process, and proactively addresses volunteer burnout before it occurs.

### Technical Architecture

VolunteerForce is engineered as a modular, scalable solution built on Salesforce's Agentforce platform with three integrated AI agents:

#### Core Components

1. **MatchMaker Agent**
   - **ML Classification Model**: Python-based machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn and TensorFlow for volunteer-project matching
   - **NLP Processing Engine**: BERT-based model for parsing project requirements and extracting key skills
   - **Predictive Scoring Algorithm**: Custom algorithm that weights skills, availability, and history to generate match scores
   - **Automated Scheduling System**: Integration with Google/Outlook APIs using REST interfaces

2. **OnboardingPro Agent**
   - **Adaptive Learning Path Generator**: Python-based recommendation engine that builds personalized training sequences
   - **LMS Integration Service**: GraphQL-based integration with Salesforce Trailhead
   - **Certification Tracking System**: Rule-based system for monitoring completion and triggering follow-ups
   - **Chatbot Support Framework**: NLP-powered conversational agent built with Rasa framework

3. **RetentionGuard Agent**
   - **Engagement Monitoring System**: Time-series analysis of volunteer activities using Python pandas
   - **Sentiment Analysis Engine**: VADER-based sentiment analyzer for processing feedback
   - **Early Warning System**: Machine learning model that identifies disengagement patterns
   - **Personalized Re-engagement Engine**: Recommendation system for tailored retention strategies

#### Technical Infrastructure

- **Development Stack**:
  - **Backend**: Python, Django REST Framework
  - **Middleware**: Salesforce Apex, Python connectors
  - **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Lightning Web Components
  - **Data Storage**: Salesforce Objects, PostgreSQL for analytics

- **Integration Architecture**:
  - **API Gateway**: REST/GraphQL interfaces for external system integration
  - **Event Bus**: Pub/Sub messaging for real-time updates
  - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with SAML for single sign-on
  - **Webhooks**: For real-time calendar and communication tool integration

- **Deployment Architecture**:
  - **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

  - **Environments**: Development, Staging, Production on Salesforce infrastructure
  - **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for system health

### Data Flow Architecture

The system processes data through several carefully designed pipelines:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**:
   - Volunteer profile collection via Salesforce forms
   - Project requirement parsing using NLP
   - Feedback collection through multi-channel inputs

2. **Processing Layer**:
   - ETL processes for data transformation and enrichment
   - ML pipeline for predictive model training and inference
   - Anomaly detection for identifying at-risk volunteers

3. **Action Layer**:
   - Recommendation generation for matches and training
   - Notification workflows for timely communication
   - Dashboard updates for admin awareness

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Performance metric collection
   - Model retraining and improvement
   - A/B testing of engagement strategies

### Implementation Details

#### 1. MatchMaker Agent Implementation

```python
# Core matching algorithm pseudocode
def calculate_match_score(volunteer, project):
    # Base score from skill match using cosine similarity
    skill_score = cosine_similarity(
        vectorize_skills(volunteer.skills),
        vectorize_skills(project.required_skills)
    )
    
    # Availability match (0-1 scale)
    availability_score = calculate_availability_overlap(
        volunteer.availability,
        project.schedule
    )
    
    # Performance history factor (0.8-1.2 scale)
    history_factor = calculate_performance_factor(
        volunteer.past_engagements
    )
    
    # Weighted final score
    final_score = (
        (skill_score * 0.6) + 
        (availability_score * 0.4)
    ) * history_factor
    
    return final_score
```

#### 2. OnboardingPro Agent Implementation

```python
# Adaptive learning path generation
def generate_learning_path(volunteer, role):
    # Get role requirements
    required_skills = get_role_requirements(role)
    
    # Assess volunteer's existing skills
    existing_skills = assess_volunteer_skills(volunteer)
    
    # Identify knowledge gaps
    skill_gaps = identify_gaps(required_skills, existing_skills)
    
    # Build personalized learning modules with dependencies
    learning_modules = []
    for gap in skill_gaps:
        modules = find_training_modules(gap)
        prerequisites = identify_prerequisites(modules, existing_skills)
        
        learning_modules.extend(prerequisites)
        learning_modules.extend(modules)
    
    # Optimize path for efficiency (topological sort)
    optimized_path = topological_sort(learning_modules)
    
    return optimized_path
```

#### 3. RetentionGuard Agent Implementation

```python
# Early warning detection system
def detect_burnout_risk(volunteer):
    # Extract engagement features
    features = extract_features(
        volunteer.activity_history,
        volunteer.communication_patterns,
        volunteer.feedback_sentiment
    )
    
    # Normalize features
    normalized_features = normalize_features(features)
    
    # Predict burnout risk using trained model
    risk_score = burnout_model.predict_proba(normalized_features)[0, 1]
    
    # Classify risk level
    if risk_score > 0.75:
        risk_level = "High"
    elif risk_score > 0.4:
        risk_level = "Medium"
    else:
        risk_level = "Low"
    
    # Generate appropriate intervention strategies
    interventions = recommend_interventions(volunteer, risk_level)
    
    return {
        "risk_score": risk_score,
        "risk_level": risk_level,
